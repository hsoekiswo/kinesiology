            <h2><a href="aries.html">Aries</a></h2>
                <h3>The First House</h3>
                    <p>The First House: <b>the sense of Self, the ego, the persona, the physical body and appearance, independently taking action.</b></p>
                    <p>This house is the first of the ‚Äòpersonal houses‚Äô, representing Personal Truth, and our experience through the body. Our physical body and its expression in the world, including our appearance, our prominent personality traits, and approach to life.</p>
                    <p>It holds the important task of establishing our personal authority based on the connection to our higher selves, that part of us which is closest to the expression of God. It rules all the activities we are carrying out in the present moment, and the perspective of our selves subjectively.</p>
                    <p>The first house is the rising sign, where the sun was rising at the time we were born, and as such shows us the truth of our identity in this life.
                    <p><b>Identification with the physical body, its vitality, power, and energy</b> in the first house leads to the <b>expression of a strong and unique personality</b> and how we identify toward others.</p>
                    <p>Through this as a foundation we are able to see ourselves as beings of Spirit.</p>

                <h3>The Second House</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Second House: The actions of the physical body in Aries and the 1st house affect the results of the 2nd house. Talents, abilities, and our life values. These together help form our sense of self- worth. Personal resources - material, mental, spiritual. Security. Wealth, sustenance, values, self- esteem, our immediate environment, childhood, stability and structure. Physical enjoyment through the senses and close friends, what we value the most in life. In Vedic astrology the 2nd house is associated with the face, mouth and sense organs, although in Western astrology it is usually associated with the neck, throat and thyroid. The association with the mouth is a strong one and associated well with one‚Äôs sense of self-worth, with the analogy that as our self-value improves, the quality of what goes into our mouth in the form of all that we consume also increases in quality. The realization that we get so much more value out of life when the quality of what we consume and the development of healthy routines is implemented. The people in our life strongly associated with the 2nd house are our close family and friends, the people who affirm our values and are a reflection of them. As our values change, so do the people who associate with us in relation to the 2nd house, meaning we may outgrow and create distance with family members who are no longer aligned.

                <h3>Themes, Symbols, and Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>Following the self-awareness of Aries, we need to find out what we value in life. Values in life related to the earthly, the sensorial, beauty, aesthetics, enjoyment. Earthly self-reliance. Pursuing these earthly values to develop self-esteem. The Bull ‚Äì strong, heavy, grounded. Grounded in the ability to pursue one‚Äôs own values. Resourcefulness, patience ‚Äì slow and steady. Sensuality, earthly and grounded qualities of life. The desire to enjoy through perceiving our values. The first of the fixed signs ‚Äì definitive, determined, specific outlook. Focuses on perfecting the things they have started rather than starting new endeavors. Strong sense of self.</p>
                    <p>Taurus is represented by the Bull, an animal of value and hard work in all cultures. It provides fertilizer, milk, hide, and even tills the land. This is the feeling behind Taurus, one of the self-reliant homesteader who creates abundance and can enjoy the beauty of what they have created through hard work, consistency, and valuing what they do and create. To enjoy the fruits of our labors. They enjoy being in communities and have a strong association with commerce and business. This plodding, consistency and tenacity to work on something for a long time can lead to stubbornness and resistance to change.</p>
                    <p>The first of the fixed signs, Taurus has an ancient esoteric symbolism associated with the Aquarian Cross ‚Äì along with Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius. It is the first step in an evolution from earth, through fire, water and finally air in Aquarius. The old symbol of Taurus was the winged bull, which is how it is portrayed in the esoteric symbolism along with the winged lion (Leo), winged eagle (the old symbol of Scorpio), and the winged human (Aquarius). The winged bull symbolises the infusion of the air element into the earth.</p>
                    <p>To balance excessive Taurean qualities look at the opposing sign of Scorpio to become more malleable, and going deeper into the spiritual values that lie behind the earthy and material.</p>
