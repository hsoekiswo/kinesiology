                <h3>The First House</h3>
                    <p>The First House: the sense of Self, the ego, the persona, the physical body and appearance, independently taking action. This house is the first of the ‘personal houses’, representing Personal Truth, and our experience through the body. Our physical body and its expression in the world, including our appearance, our prominent personality traits, and approach to life. It holds the important task of establishing our personal authority based on the connection to our higher selves, that part of us which is closest to the expression of God. It rules all the activities we are carrying out in the present moment, and the perspective of our selves subjectively. The first house is the rising sign, where the sun was rising at the time we were born, and as such shows us the truth of our identity in this life. Identification with the physical body, its vitality, power, and energy in the first house leads to the expression of a strong and unique personality and how we identify toward others. Through this as a foundation we are able to see ourselves as beings of Spirit.</p>
