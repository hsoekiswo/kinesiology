                        <h3>üíä Bellis perenis</h3>
                            <p>Bellis perenis, the common daisy, is a humble mat-forming herbaceous perennial. It prefers nutritious, calcareous soils and grows slowly, but with time it will cover large areas. It is a hardy plant, and despite being trodden on repeatedly as a ground cover, will always ‚Äòcome up smiling afterwards‚Äô. It can become aggressive and dominant in a pasture. Daisy have a prominent place in folklore as being used for divination, by plucking the petals off - particularly related to inquiring into the fidelity of a lover -‚Äòhe loves me, he loves me not‚Äô. Daisy chains are also a favorite in the British and European cultures.</p>
                            <p>As a homeopathic remedy my use was almost exclusively as a <b>postpartum remedy</b> for <b>hemorrhaging</b> when Arnica failed to help. Closely related to Arnica in character, the group theme is one of having a potent protective effect on the boundaries of the organism, preventing intrusion and quickly dispatching other living things that attempt violation of the body‚Äôs integrity. They keep what belongs inside and out what belongs outside. Toughness of the personality: stoic, hard, domineering, defiant, obstinate, self-sufficient. It is <b>reminiscent of the body‚Äôs tough glue</b>, hyaluronic acid, in connective fibers that hold the body together and form and barrier against intrusion.</p>

                                The oak is still considered one of the strongest trees to dominate a landscape. They stand solid and majestic, sometimes alone in a field or pasture, sometimes in forests. Oak timber is considered one of the most hardy in carpentry. Oak is considered the most sacred tree to the Druids, the ancestors of all British and European religions - a tree imbued with the mystical authority of nature. In my experience Oak is called upon in homeopathic potency when we are facing trials and tribulations in life that require the kind of strength and support that accesses the spiritual realms. The energy of oak is paternal, protective, sheltering, restoring nature‚Äôs law, and gives resolution and strength of will to the seeker.

                                Well-known as a ‚Äòteething‚Äô remedy in homeopathy. It is indicated in almost all problems that arise during teething including teething pain, inflammation, diarrhea, coughs/colds, skin eruptions etc. The mind is also affected, causing an irritated, angry, discontented disposition where nothing seems to satisfy - this state can be seen in both children and adults. It is well-known in both homeopathic and herbal medicine as a coffee antidote.

                                Probably the most widely-used homeopathic remedy on the planet. Most commonly called for in all kinds of bruises and injuries, more particularly where there is pain and inflammation in muscular tissue. The Arnica theme is one of ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt need help, leave me alone, I can do it on my own‚Äô, which leads to a resentful stoicism and the inability to ask for help when needed. This, in turn, leads to a state of exhaustion and collapse. Arnica has the strong characteristic of not wanting to be touched. ‚ÄòThe problem with being so strong is that if you are tired nobody would care to ask if you need help‚Äô.

                            Iron is the metal of strength, industry, self-defense, warcraft, tilling the land (although copper is
                            actually better suited to this), and building. In the body it is the symbol of vitality, carries oxygen
                            throughout the body via the red blood cells - the symbol of life and the etheric body. According to Rudolf
                            Steiner, blood is the vehicle of the ‚ÄòI‚Äô body, or spirit body. Iron binds the human to the earth in a way,
                            connecting the spirit body to the physical body. This is shown in the fact that there are two forms of iron:
                            one that comes from inside the earth and one that comes from the cosmos in the form of meteoric iron.
                            Wilhelm Pelikan in his book ‚ÄòThe Secrets of Metals‚Äô, opens the chapter on iron with this:
                            ‚ÄòWe cannot speak of iron in the same way as of lead and tin. Iron is so important and indispensable to all
                            kingdoms of nature, as well as to human beings, that in it we become immediately and directly aware of what
                            in other metals we must seek out as a hidden side of life. Iron is an important constituent of the mineral
                            kingdom. It permeates the earth everywhere, all rocks and soils. Among the seven metals it is the most
                            abundant‚Äô. Iron makes up around 4.7% of the earth‚Äôs crust. About 70% of iron in the human body is essential
                            iron found in hemoglobin, myoglobin and intracellular iron-containing enzymes. The remaining 30% is storage
                            or non-essential iron found in the liver, bone marrow, spleen, and skeletal muscle in the form of ferritin
                            and haemosiderin. Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies on the planet, with
                            both physical and spiritual implications on the human being.

                            <p>
                                Commonly referred to as Broadleaf plantain in English, and Don Sendok (Spoonleaf) in Indonesia, Plantago is one of a few herbs that grows universally in nearly any part of the world. When teaching my Indonesian Materia Medica, I refer to Plantago as the Arnica of Indonesia. In keeping with the theme of Aries, the way it grows as a plant is almost stoic. It prefers to grow wild on footpaths, roads, and flat areas that are frequently trodden or sat on. It is almost as if this herb likes to be stepped on, or even driven over.
                                Herbal indications: Speeds up wound healing - both internal and external, treats urinary tract infections, burns, insect bites and stings, hemorrhoids, toothache and conjunctivitis. The plant has the ability to draw toxins out of the body and is used in the tropics for all kinds of venomous bites. Other uses include cancer treatment, tuberculosis, ulcers, diarrhea, and high cholesterol.

                                Centella, Gotu kola, or in Indonesia ‚ÄòPegagan‚Äô and Balinese ‚ÄòDon Piduh‚Äô, is best known as a herb that promotes microcirculation with the ability to nourish and restore neural pathways in the brain. This is a central theme in Aries, as the head and frontal lobes of the brain are a place of energy and power and thereby require support. Similar to Plantago, it is used as a blood-cleanser and detoxifier for septic, toxic, and venomous wounds. In Indian and other Asian esoteric herbal traditions it is taken to increase spiritual powers and promote longevity. It is often found growing near Plantago and is similarly a ground cover that is often trodden on. Its herbal actions are tonic, anti-inflammatory, wound-healing, diuretic, laxative, and sedative. It is used to treat skin ulcers and leprosy. Increases immunity and promotes cellular regeneration. Supports liver function and helps in reducing high blood pressure. It has a cooling, watery effect on the body, and grows best in moist, damp, cool environments in the tropics, often near rivers, lakes and springs.

                    <h3>üßÇ Kali phos</h3>
                    <p>The primary action and association of Kali-phos with Aries is seen in the brain. This mineral is found throughout the grey matter of the brain and in the nerves throughout the body. Its action is one of promoting the firing of neurons and production of nerve fluid, thereby nourishing the nervous system. From this perspective it can be seen that it is a perfect compliment to the herbs and homeopathic remedies indicated for Aries. The striving, self-willed, and ambitious drive head-first into any challenge of the Aries energy requires both protection and nutrition of the nervous system which is supported by this tissue salt. As well as supporting brain power, Kali phos also helps to ease tension and even helps bring tranquility to the brain if ‚Äòoverheated‚Äô.
                        Another function is as an alkalizing agent in the body, helping to balance states of over-acidity. Useful to overcome states of weakness, debility, overwork, and nervous exhaustion.

                            As the name suggests, this remedy is useful to balance out impatience, irritability, and nervousness. The person wants everything done quickly, including finishing the sentence of someone because they speak too slowly. Relieves mental tension arising from frustration. Impetuous and accident prone. They are restless, jumpy and reactive, moving and talking quickly. Helps this type of person to regain poise in life, so that they can take their time and enjoy the pleasures of life. Impatiens is extensively cultivated in Bali in a wide range of colors used in the fundamental mandala-form offering called a ‚ÄòCanang‚Äô.

We also notice its incredible beauty, and the attractive and delicious fruit that will form after. Just the name ‚Äòpassionfruit‚Äô alludes to the fact that this fruit will captivate the senses. Despite its sensuality there is a deeper spiritual significance associated to this flower that was seen by the Christian missionaries who found it growing in the Caribbean. They associated the different parts of the flower with the passion of the Christ, with the following observations:

                        The five sepals and five petals: the ten apostles present with Christ during his passion (excluding Peter and Judas)
                        The three stigma: the three nails that held the Christ to the cross
                        The five anthers: the five wounds of the Christ (hands, feet and side)
                        The filaments: the crown of thorns
                        The leaves with 3 points: the Holy Trinity
                        The vine: God s attachment to the earth
                        The deeper spiritual symbolism also hints at the fact that this plant must be associated with the impulse of forgiveness, redemption and liberation. This can be seen in the therapeutic application of Passiflora in helping people deal with various addictions including hard drugs and narcotics. In keeping with the theme and archetype of Taurus, I have observed that Passiflora helps to bring a spiritual impulse to an overly-materialized Taurus energy, helping to liberate someone from the attachments of the sensory world, where there has been an excess in heaviness and material pursuits. While many of the remedy choices relating to signs made complete sense, Passiflora in Taurus was an unexpected, and at surface value, a strange candidate. However, on deeper examination it now makes complete sense. I have also observed that the mental and physical symptoms were observable in many patients who tested positive for Taurus as a priority for their Transformational healing process. Note how there are many similarities between Passiflora and Cuprum. Passiflora is a more recent addition to the homeopathic Materia Medica, hence there are still only a few symptoms and characteristics to reference.

                        <p>
                            Citrullus colocynthis, or bitter cucumber, is a wild gourd native to the deserts of Asia Minor and the Mediterranean. It has a strong affection with the gallbladder and is known as the best remedy in homeopathy for colic and cramping pains of the abdomen. In the zodiacal remedial context, it corresponds to a Taurean state of irritability and anger that is either suppressed or in the process of being released. A good remedy for infants who experience colic, especially if associated with irritability or anger in the mother. Again, we see the Taurean or even Venusian theme of cramps featuring heavily here.

                            This plant, commonly known as scouring rush, has a strong affinity with the kidneys, bladder and urinary tract in general. This is in keeping with the Taurean association to Venus, which rules this organ system. Hence it will often be indicated where there are urinary symptoms associated with a need to balance and support Taurus in an individual. Characteristics and symptoms may include cystitis, frequent urination, bedwetting, kidney disorders, and water retention, and is used to balance an excessively phlegmatic and sluggish state, which is a sign of a stagnant Taurus.

                            This was another intuitive remedy I was called to make upon seeing the frequent indications in patients for two other grain remedies in the zodiacal pantheon ‚Äì Tritium vulgare (wheat) and Avena sativa (oats). It is no accident that rice came up as indicated for the sign of the Bull, seeing as the rice paddies throughout the world have been closely associated with the cow and buffalo. Their manure fertilizes the field, and they are used as beasts of burden to till the mud before planting. To this day the cows in Bali are kept near their farmer‚Äôs rice fields in rural settings where they are still used in the rice paddies. There are no Materia Medica references for this remedy that I have found, however I have prescribed it where there is a potential intolerance to rice ‚Äì a growing problem here in Indonesia, possibly due to the excessive build-up of chemicals in the rice fields.

I asked her to bring me some leaves and cones and small branches with which I made a mother tincture that we have used to prepare the remedy. The remedy is uplifting in general, brining clarity of thought, a sense of well-being, and rejuvenation, helping with difficulty concentrating and slowness of thoughts. It is useful in bringing an uplifted and inspired energy to the potentially heavy Taurus.

                            The ink of the cuttlefish has been used to create one of the most frequently- prescribed remedies in the homeopathic apothecary. Traditionally I have placed this remedy under the influence of Venus, making it more than relevant in the Taurean context. The association with Taurus is clear, in that Sepia is used in cases of worn-out householders who have become weighed down with the burdens of maintaining the basic needs of the house, family and material obligations. Heavy, bearing-down sensations, especially in the pelvic region. Are Thoresen associates Taurus with the endocrine system, and Bonnie Gillespie with the Thyroid gland ‚Äì both areas that come under the influence of Sepia. It is useful in all kinds of reproductive hormone imbalances and hypothyroidism. In the mental sphere, Sepia is for people (especially women) who long for a creative outlet to bring inspiration to an otherwise monotonous life of taking care of the family and household.

                <h3>ü™ô Cuprum (Copper)</h3>
                    <p>My impressions of copper have always been positive and full of warmth. It is a metal of many practical applications in daily life, from industry, to farming, to commerce (copper coins), weaponry (pre-iron age), electrical conduction and IT, and as a protective shield against electromagnetic radiation. Rudolf Steiner and Viktor Schauberger (aka ‚ÄòThe Water Wizard‚Äô), both Austrians and spiritual scientists, propounded the use of copper tools for farming as being more harmonious with the land and found that soil tilled with copper tools resulted in healthier plants and bigger yields. Personally, I saw the explanation for why this might happen as being the alchemical correspondence of copper to Venus ‚Äì representing love, beauty, abundance, nurturing and value, in stark contrast to Mars which is the planet of war and conquest, defense, combat, and law. In farming it would make more sense to nurture the land rather than have a fight with it! Copper is a trace element, essential for the health of plants, animals and humans. In fact, certain sea mollusks use copper in the blood to breathe, in the same way humans use iron. In the human body, the highest concentrations of copper are found in the liver, and in significant levels in the brain, kidneys, pancreas, heart, muscles and bones. Interestingly, as metabolism increases, so does the copper level in a person. And if it drops, like in hypothyroidism, copper levels also fall. High serum copper levels are also found in patients with mental illnesses including schizophrenia and manic-depressive disorders.
                        The great Alchemist Paracelsus and later Rademacher cited copper as being a universal remedy useful in the treatment of diseases like pneumonia, epilepsy, hysteria, tuberculosis, rheumatism, edema, and dysentery. It was also known that copper workers were protected from cholera during the pandemics. Copper is well-known as anti-parasitic, antibacterial and anti-fungal.
                        Copper is the third most abundant trace element in the body after iron and zinc.

                            Thuja occidentalis, Eastern Arbor Vitae or White Cedar, is a cedar tree found throughout Asia, Europe, the Americas, and most countries on the planet. Its therapeutic use is attributed to Dr Samuel Hahnemann, the father of homeopathy, who observed its effects on a monk who chewed the leaves every day. Not used in herbal medicine due to a potentially toxic effect if ingested in large amounts, it is safely used in small drop doses, or as a topical spray of tincture. I have found it clears stagnant and parasitic energies, along with energies associated with lies - both within the person and even in the people around them. ‚ÄòThe Truth Serum‚Äô. Clears energies that no longer serve the highest good of the person seeking transformation. I have always associated this herb with Venus, making its connection to Taurus a logical one.
                            Herbal indications: Strong affinity for the urinary tract and reproductive system, as well as the skin. The leaves have been used to treat bronchial infections, UTIs, genital infections, warts and skin infections. The twigs are used for rheumatism, and the inner bark for delayed menstruation.
                            NOTE: do not prescribe Thuja internally in amounts exceeding 7 drops of tincture

In recent times, mangosteen skin extract has been used as a powerful antioxidant, protective against heart disease, diabetes, cancer and many other conditions. Taking an imaginative look at the plant we can see Taurean characteristics embodied in the color and texture of the skin, the slow steady growth of the tree, and when the time is right the bearing of abundant and sensual fruits that bring both health and sexual joy to many.

                    <p>
                        The primary action of Nat sulph is to expel excessive water from the body, and it acts immediately on the liver and the blood, keeping in nature with the action of copper in the liver, blood and closely related to the element sulphur. Where Nat sulph is deficient, stagnant states develop. This becomes especially important in environments that have a high level of atmospheric humidity and water in the surrounding environment. Malaria is a condition that can occur when there is an overload of water in the body and a deficiency of Nat sulph to help expel it ‚Äì hence the fevers and sweats of the malaria state are initiated by the body to force the water out.
                        Nat sulph is found in the intracellular fluids, from where it regulates the water content of the blood, tissues and cells of the body. In the respiratory system this may lead to a build-up of fluid or mucous. It is especially important for the function of the gallbladder and pancreas. A deficiency can lead to sluggishness and obstruction of the gallbladder and reduced action of the pancreas, leading to blood- sugar irregularities. The typical headache of Nat sulph is located in the occiput ‚Äì the back of the head, associated with the gallbladder and liver. It is also one of the tissue salts used to treat excessive uric acid in the body.
                        In the context of Taurus, Nat sulph reduces stagnancy and helps the body to shed excessive baggage in the form of water.
