                            Iron is the metal of strength, industry, self-defense, warcraft, tilling the land (although copper is
                            actually better suited to this), and building. In the body it is the symbol of vitality, carries oxygen
                            throughout the body via the red blood cells - the symbol of life and the etheric body. According to Rudolf
                            Steiner, blood is the vehicle of the ‘I’ body, or spirit body. Iron binds the human to the earth in a way,
                            connecting the spirit body to the physical body. This is shown in the fact that there are two forms of iron:
                            one that comes from inside the earth and one that comes from the cosmos in the form of meteoric iron.
                            Wilhelm Pelikan in his book ‘The Secrets of Metals’, opens the chapter on iron with this:
                            ‘We cannot speak of iron in the same way as of lead and tin. Iron is so important and indispensable to all
                            kingdoms of nature, as well as to human beings, that in it we become immediately and directly aware of what
                            in other metals we must seek out as a hidden side of life. Iron is an important constituent of the mineral
                            kingdom. It permeates the earth everywhere, all rocks and soils. Among the seven metals it is the most
                            abundant’. Iron makes up around 4.7% of the earth’s crust. About 70% of iron in the human body is essential
                            iron found in hemoglobin, myoglobin and intracellular iron-containing enzymes. The remaining 30% is storage
                            or non-essential iron found in the liver, bone marrow, spleen, and skeletal muscle in the form of ferritin
                            and haemosiderin. Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies on the planet, with
                            both physical and spiritual implications on the human being.

                        <h3>Plantago major</h3>
                            <p>
                                Commonly referred to as Broadleaf plantain in English, and Don Sendok (Spoonleaf) in Indonesia, Plantago is one of a few herbs that grows universally in nearly any part of the world. When teaching my Indonesian Materia Medica, I refer to Plantago as the Arnica of Indonesia. In keeping with the theme of Aries, the way it grows as a plant is almost stoic. It prefers to grow wild on footpaths, roads, and flat areas that are frequently trodden or sat on. It is almost as if this herb likes to be stepped on, or even driven over.
                                Herbal indications: Speeds up wound healing - both internal and external, treats urinary tract infections, burns, insect bites and stings, hemorrhoids, toothache and conjunctivitis. The plant has the ability to draw toxins out of the body and is used in the tropics for all kinds of venomous bites. Other uses include cancer treatment, tuberculosis, ulcers, diarrhea, and high cholesterol.

                        <h3>Centella asiatica</h3>
                            <p>
                                Centella, Gotu kola, or in Indonesia ‘Pegagan’ and Balinese ‘Don Piduh’, is best known as a herb that promotes microcirculation with the ability to nourish and restore neural pathways in the brain. This is a central theme in Aries, as the head and frontal lobes of the brain are a place of energy and power and thereby require support. Similar to Plantago, it is used as a blood-cleanser and detoxifier for septic, toxic, and venomous wounds. In Indian and other Asian esoteric herbal traditions it is taken to increase spiritual powers and promote longevity. It is often found growing near Plantago and is similarly a ground cover that is often trodden on. Its herbal actions are tonic, anti-inflammatory, wound-healing, diuretic, laxative, and sedative. It is used to treat skin ulcers and leprosy. Increases immunity and promotes cellular regeneration. Supports liver function and helps in reducing high blood pressure. It has a cooling, watery effect on the body, and grows best in moist, damp, cool environments in the tropics, often near rivers, lakes and springs.

                    <h3>Kali phos</h3>
                    <p>The primary action and association of Kali-phos with Aries is seen in the brain. This mineral is found throughout the grey matter of the brain and in the nerves throughout the body. Its action is one of promoting the firing of neurons and production of nerve fluid, thereby nourishing the nervous system. From this perspective it can be seen that it is a perfect compliment to the herbs and homeopathic remedies indicated for Aries. The striving, self-willed, and ambitious drive head-first into any challenge of the Aries energy requires both protection and nutrition of the nervous system which is supported by this tissue salt. As well as supporting brain power, Kali phos also helps to ease tension and even helps bring tranquility to the brain if ‘overheated’.
                        Another function is as an alkalizing agent in the body, helping to balance states of over-acidity. Useful to overcome states of weakness, debility, overwork, and nervous exhaustion.

                        <p>
                            As the name suggests, this remedy is useful to balance out impatience, irritability, and nervousness. The person wants everything done quickly, including finishing the sentence of someone because they speak too slowly. Relieves mental tension arising from frustration. Impetuous and accident prone. They are restless, jumpy and reactive, moving and talking quickly. Helps this type of person to regain poise in life, so that they can take their time and enjoy the pleasures of life. Impatiens is extensively cultivated in Bali in a wide range of colors used in the fundamental mandala-form offering called a ‘Canang’.

                <h3>Cuprum (Copper)</h3>
                    <p>My impressions of copper have always been positive and full of warmth. It is a metal of many practical applications in daily life, from industry, to farming, to commerce (copper coins), weaponry (pre-iron age), electrical conduction and IT, and as a protective shield against electromagnetic radiation. Rudolf Steiner and Viktor Schauberger (aka ‘The Water Wizard’), both Austrians and spiritual scientists, propounded the use of copper tools for farming as being more harmonious with the land and found that soil tilled with copper tools resulted in healthier plants and bigger yields. Personally, I saw the explanation for why this might happen as being the alchemical correspondence of copper to Venus – representing love, beauty, abundance, nurturing and value, in stark contrast to Mars which is the planet of war and conquest, defense, combat, and law. In farming it would make more sense to nurture the land rather than have a fight with it! Copper is a trace element, essential for the health of plants, animals and humans. In fact, certain sea mollusks use copper in the blood to breathe, in the same way humans use iron. In the human body, the highest concentrations of copper are found in the liver, and in significant levels in the brain, kidneys, pancreas, heart, muscles and bones. Interestingly, as metabolism increases, so does the copper level in a person. And if it drops, like in hypothyroidism, copper levels also fall. High serum copper levels are also found in patients with mental illnesses including schizophrenia and manic-depressive disorders.
                        The great Alchemist Paracelsus and later Rademacher cited copper as being a universal remedy useful in the treatment of diseases like pneumonia, epilepsy, hysteria, tuberculosis, rheumatism, edema, and dysentery. It was also known that copper workers were protected from cholera during the pandemics. Copper is well-known as anti-parasitic, antibacterial and anti-fungal.
                        Copper is the third most abundant trace element in the body after iron and zinc.

                        <p>
                            Thuja occidentalis, Eastern Arbor Vitae or White Cedar, is a cedar tree found throughout Asia, Europe, the Americas, and most countries on the planet. Its therapeutic use is attributed to Dr Samuel Hahnemann, the father of homeopathy, who observed its effects on a monk who chewed the leaves every day. Not used in herbal medicine due to a potentially toxic effect if ingested in large amounts, it is safely used in small drop doses, or as a topical spray of tincture. I have found it clears stagnant and parasitic energies, along with energies associated with lies - both within the person and even in the people around them. ‘The Truth Serum’. Clears energies that no longer serve the highest good of the person seeking transformation. I have always associated this herb with Venus, making its connection to Taurus a logical one.
                            Herbal indications: Strong affinity for the urinary tract and reproductive system, as well as the skin. The leaves have been used to treat bronchial infections, UTIs, genital infections, warts and skin infections. The twigs are used for rheumatism, and the inner bark for delayed menstruation.
                            NOTE: do not prescribe Thuja internally in amounts exceeding 7 drops of tincture

In recent times, mangosteen skin extract has been used as a powerful antioxidant, protective against heart disease, diabetes, cancer and many other conditions. Taking an imaginative look at the plant we can see Taurean characteristics embodied in the color and texture of the skin, the slow steady growth of the tree, and when the time is right the bearing of abundant and sensual fruits that bring both health and sexual joy to many.

                    <p>
                        The primary action of Nat sulph is to expel excessive water from the body, and it acts immediately on the liver and the blood, keeping in nature with the action of copper in the liver, blood and closely related to the element sulphur. Where Nat sulph is deficient, stagnant states develop. This becomes especially important in environments that have a high level of atmospheric humidity and water in the surrounding environment. Malaria is a condition that can occur when there is an overload of water in the body and a deficiency of Nat sulph to help expel it – hence the fevers and sweats of the malaria state are initiated by the body to force the water out.
                        Nat sulph is found in the intracellular fluids, from where it regulates the water content of the blood, tissues and cells of the body. In the respiratory system this may lead to a build-up of fluid or mucous. It is especially important for the function of the gallbladder and pancreas. A deficiency can lead to sluggishness and obstruction of the gallbladder and reduced action of the pancreas, leading to blood- sugar irregularities. The typical headache of Nat sulph is located in the occiput – the back of the head, associated with the gallbladder and liver. It is also one of the tissue salts used to treat excessive uric acid in the body.
                        In the context of Taurus, Nat sulph reduces stagnancy and helps the body to shed excessive baggage in the form of water.

                        This flower helps people with a negative outlook, melancholy, who are easily discouraged when things go wrong or not as expected.
                        Refusal to see that it is one’s own lack of faith and understanding that prevents overcoming their problems. Helps to regain confidence after the mind is full of doubts as a result of initial failure.

                        It helps dispel negative thinking and allows a positive attitude to return, with an ‘I will succeed’ outlook.
