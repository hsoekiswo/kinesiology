                        Iron is the metal of strength, industry, self-defense, warcraft, tilling the land (although copper is
                        actually better suited to this), and building. In the body it is the symbol of vitality, carries oxygen
                        throughout the body via the red blood cells - the symbol of life and the etheric body. According to Rudolf
                        Steiner, blood is the vehicle of the ‚ÄòI‚Äô body, or spirit body. Iron binds the human to the earth in a way,
                        connecting the spirit body to the physical body. This is shown in the fact that there are two forms of iron:
                        one that comes from inside the earth and one that comes from the cosmos in the form of meteoric iron.
                        Wilhelm Pelikan in his book ‚ÄòThe Secrets of Metals‚Äô, opens the chapter on iron with this:
                        ‚ÄòWe cannot speak of iron in the same way as of lead and tin. Iron is so important and indispensable to all
                        kingdoms of nature, as well as to human beings, that in it we become immediately and directly aware of what
                        in other metals we must seek out as a hidden side of life. Iron is an important constituent of the mineral
                        kingdom. It permeates the earth everywhere, all rocks and soils. Among the seven metals it is the most
                        abundant‚Äô. Iron makes up around 4.7% of the earth‚Äôs crust. About 70% of iron in the human body is essential
                        iron found in hemoglobin, myoglobin and intracellular iron-containing enzymes. The remaining 30% is storage
                        or non-essential iron found in the liver, bone marrow, spleen, and skeletal muscle in the form of ferritin
                        and haemosiderin. Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies on the planet, with
                        both physical and spiritual implications on the human being.

                    <h3>Plantago major</h3>
                        <p>
                            Commonly referred to as Broadleaf plantain in English, and Don Sendok (Spoonleaf) in Indonesia, Plantago is one of a few herbs that grows universally in nearly any part of the world. When teaching my Indonesian Materia Medica, I refer to Plantago as the Arnica of Indonesia. In keeping with the theme of Aries, the way it grows as a plant is almost stoic. It prefers to grow wild on footpaths, roads, and flat areas that are frequently trodden or sat on. It is almost as if this herb likes to be stepped on, or even driven over.
                            Herbal indications: Speeds up wound healing - both internal and external, treats urinary tract infections, burns, insect bites and stings, hemorrhoids, toothache and conjunctivitis. The plant has the ability to draw toxins out of the body and is used in the tropics for all kinds of venomous bites. Other uses include cancer treatment, tuberculosis, ulcers, diarrhea, and high cholesterol.

                    <h3>Centella asiatica</h3>
                        <p>
                            Centella, Gotu kola, or in Indonesia ‚ÄòPegagan‚Äô and Balinese ‚ÄòDon Piduh‚Äô, is best known as a herb that promotes microcirculation with the ability to nourish and restore neural pathways in the brain. This is a central theme in Aries, as the head and frontal lobes of the brain are a place of energy and power and thereby require support. Similar to Plantago, it is used as a blood-cleanser and detoxifier for septic, toxic, and venomous wounds. In Indian and other Asian esoteric herbal traditions it is taken to increase spiritual powers and promote longevity. It is often found growing near Plantago and is similarly a ground cover that is often trodden on. Its herbal actions are tonic, anti-inflammatory, wound-healing, diuretic, laxative, and sedative. It is used to treat skin ulcers and leprosy. Increases immunity and promotes cellular regeneration. Supports liver function and helps in reducing high blood pressure. It has a cooling, watery effect on the body, and grows best in moist, damp, cool environments in the tropics, often near rivers, lakes and springs.
