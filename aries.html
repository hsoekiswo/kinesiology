                <h2>More About Aries</h2>
                <h3>The First House</h3>
                <p>The First House: the sense of Self, the ego, the persona, the physical body and appearance, independently taking action. This house is the first of the â€˜personal housesâ€™, representing Personal Truth, and our experience through the body. Our physical body and its expression in the world, including our appearance, our prominent personality traits, and approach to life. It holds the important task of establishing our personal authority based on the connection to our higher selves, that part of us which is closest to the expression of God. It rules all the activities we are carrying out in the present moment, and the perspective of our selves subjectively. The first house is the rising sign, where the sun was rising at the time we were born, and as such shows us the truth of our identity in this life. Identification with the physical body, its vitality, power, and energy in the first house leads to the expression of a strong and unique personality and how we identify toward others. Through this as a foundation we are able to see ourselves as beings of Spirit.</p>
                <h3>Themes, Symbols, and Characteristics</h3>

                        Iron is the metal of strength, industry, self-defense, warcraft, tilling the land (although copper is actually better suited to this), and building. In the body it is the symbol of vitality, carries oxygen throughout the body via the red blood cells - the symbol of life and the etheric body. According to Rudolf Steiner, blood is the vehicle of the â€˜Iâ€™ body, or spirit body. Iron binds the human to the earth in a way, connecting the spirit body to the physical body. This is shown in the fact that there are two forms of iron: one that comes from inside the earth and one that comes from the cosmos in the form of meteoric iron.
                        Wilhelm Pelikan in his book â€˜The Secrets of Metalsâ€™, opens the chapter on iron with this:
                        â€˜We cannot speak of iron in the same way as of lead and tin. Iron is so important and indispensable to all kingdoms of nature, as well as to human beings, that in it we become immediately and directly aware of what in other metals we must seek out as a hidden side of life. Iron is an important constituent of the mineral kingdom. It permeates the earth everywhere, all rocks and soils. Among the seven metals it is the most abundantâ€™. Iron makes up around 4.7% of the earthâ€™s crust. About 70% of iron in the human body is essential iron found in hemoglobin, myoglobin and intracellular iron-containing enzymes. The remaining 30% is storage or non-essential iron found in the liver, bone marrow, spleen, and skeletal muscle in the form of ferritin and haemosiderin. Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies on the planet, with both physical and spiritual implications on the human being.
